# TDbank-Auto-Ledger



It's basically made by my own needs.



### How To Use

1. Download all .csv files on your "TD Easyweb"
2. Download Main.py
3. Make an folder and put Main.py in it
4. Make an folder into the folder which contains Main.py and rename the inside folder as "CSV"
5. Move all .csv files into "CSV" folder
6. Run the code

### Features

- [x] Collapse all things in several .csv file into one excel file
- [x] Divide rows by month and create new month sheet automatically 
- [ ] GUI



### Caution

1. Folder name have to be all capital
2. Yet, if .csv file contains same banking statement, code will put all of it anyway (will be solved)
